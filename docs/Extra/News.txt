Version 0.0.5 :D
So from here out I am focusing on the game rather than the framework, since the API is almost complete. Documentation has been paused and now functionality will be paramount until the point where I feel that the game is playable and 'fun' for example when the game can be played 10 minutes straight without the gameplay feeling boring or repetitive.
A reasonable target, as I am sure you will agree! (!Cringe alert!) So, ladies and gentlemen, sit back and enjoy the development ride!
