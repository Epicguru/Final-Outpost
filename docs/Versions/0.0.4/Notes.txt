- Removed old physics system, which despite being pretty cool was really buggy and not practical.
- Added good old Box2D :D. Here come the crashes!
- Made new entity system based of Ashley framework. Implemented with player.
- Added stone tile, that has a physics body.]
- Many bugs, much debug, such wow.
- Made so that having no plugins or parsers makes the game display an error and not start up.
- Made a launcher. Yay! Rather cool if I say so myself.
